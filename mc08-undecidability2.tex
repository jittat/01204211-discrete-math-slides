  For this problem:
  
  \begin{block}{}
    Given an integer $x$, is $x$ odd?
  \end{block}

  we can define a corresponding language
  \[
  L_E=\{,\ldots,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,\ldots\}.

  To solve this problem, given $x$, we can ask if $x\in L_E$.

  We say that a python program $P$ {\color{red}\bf decides} the
  language $L$ if for any input string $x$, $P$ when running with $x$
  as an input,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $P$ always terminates, 
  \item $P$ outputs {\tt\bf yes}, if $x\in L$, and
  \item $P$ outputs {\tt\bf no}, if $x\not\in L$.

  If we believe that anything that a computer can do can be written as
  a python program, and there is no python program that decides a

\begin{frame}[fragile=true]

  \begin{lemma}
    There is no python program that decides $A$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    We prove by contradiction. Assume that there is a python program
    $P$ that decides $A$.  \pause

    We describe a python program $B$ that reads a string $Q$ as an
    input as follows:

    {\small
\begin{verbatim}
Program B
Input Q
1.    Load P as module Pmod
2.    if Pmod.main(Q) == 'yes':    # when Pmod outputs yes
3.       while True: pass          #   loop forever 
4.    else:                        # when Pmod outputs no
5.       quit()                    #   halt
\end{verbatim}
    }

    Given program $Q$ as an input, $B$ loops forever when \pause

    It terminates when
  \end{proof}
\end{frame}

\frame{
  \begin{proof}
    We know that
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $B(Q)$ loops when $Q(Q)$ terminates, and
    \item $B(Q)$ terminates when $Q(Q)$ loops.
    \end{itemize}

    Does running $B$ using $B$ as an input terminate?

    \pause

    Let's try to plug in $Q=B$.  We have
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $B(B)$ loops when \pause $B(B)$ terminates, \pause and
    \item $B(B)$ terminates when \pause $B(B)$ loops. \pause
    \end{itemize}

    Since either $B(B)$ loops or terminates, and we cannot be in any
    of the cases, we obtain a contradiction.

    Therefore, we conclude that program $P$ does not exist.

      We prove the lemma by contradiction.  Assume that there is a

      We have to make sure that our reduction is correct by considering
      two cases.
      
      Case 1: when $P(w)$ halts. \pause

      Case 2: when $P(w)$ does not halt. \pause

      Since in both cases, $C$ answers correctly, we know that given
      program $Q$ deciding {\sc Accept}, we can construct a program
      $C$ that decides {\sc Halt}.  However, we know that {\sc Halt}
      is undecidable; thus, we reach a contradiction.  We conclude

    It's another to show that computers can't do something.

  Mathematician David Hilbert asked:

  {''Find a process according to which it can be determined by a
    finite number of operations if a given polynomial has intergral
    root''}

}

\frame{
  \frametitle{To say NO}

  We need an argument (a mathematical proof) that covers all possible
  ``processes'' or all ``computations''.

  \item Turing's machines

  No, there doesn't exist any algorithm for determining if a
  polynomial has integral root.
